# Fall-Game
Fall Game is a simple yet fun browser-based game where the player controls a red ball character, navigating it left and right to fall through holes that appear in black blocks. The objective is to avoid hitting the blocks and survive as long as possible while scoring points based on the number of blocks passed through successfully.
